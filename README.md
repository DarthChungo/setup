## Setup

The simple VS-Code C/C++ code boiler-plate generator that
automatically generates a folder structure, main file with
example code, custom tasks to build and clean and a launch
task to debug with VS-Code's gdb. All with a simple command.

Written as a simple shell script that can be compiled with
shc (Shell Compiler). A precompiled binary can be found in the
build directory.
